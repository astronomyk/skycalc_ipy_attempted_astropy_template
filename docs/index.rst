Documentation
=============

This is the documentation for SkyCalc iPy.
Provides a wrapper for the skycalc_cli command line tool. The wrapper sends the
necessary parameters to the ESO SkyCalc server, saves the recieved FITS file,
and returns the transmission and emission spectra in a Pythonic way. This is
useful for those who want to interact with SkyCalc inside a Python environment
